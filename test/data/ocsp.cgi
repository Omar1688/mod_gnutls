# This is a CGI script to run the OpenSSL OCSP responder from a web
# server. The CGI environment must provide the following four
# variables to configure the OCSP responder:
#
# CA_CERT: CA certificate of the CA that issued the certificates this
# OCSP reponder should provide status information for
#
# OCSP_INDEX: CA index file in the format used by OpenSSL
#
# OCSP_CERT: Certificate that should be used to sign OCSP reponses
# (either CA_CERT or a dedicated OCSP signer certificate, see RFC
# 6960, Section 4.2.2.2)
#
# OCSP_KEY: Private key for OCSP_CERT
#
# Additionally, the OpenSSL binary to use can be configured through
# the OPENSSL environment variable. If it is not set, the PATH will be
# searched.
