"""Test case hooks for mod_gnutls tests.

Test cases can implement hooks that (depending on the hook) override
or supplement the default test run behavior. Three hooks are currently
supported:

    prepare_env:

        This hook runs before the test services are started. It serves
        two purposes:

        1. Check special precondition the test might need
        (e.g. availability of a certain Apache module), and raise
        unittest.SkipTest to skip the test case if they are not met.

        2. Set any additional environment variables the test might
        need.

        If the hook creates any resources that need to be cleaned up
        after the test (e.g. delete a temporary file), it should
        return a callable which performs the cleanup. That callable
        will be called without arguments when the test services are
        stopped.

    run_connection:

        Will be called *instead* of mgstests.tests.run_test_conf() and
        is expected to run whatever client actions the test
        requires. This hook receives three parameters:

        * testname: string containing the test name
        * conn_log: file object for connection logging
        * response_log: file object for HTTP response logging

    post_check:

        Execute additional checks if desired. This hook is called
        after the test client run and after the test environment
        terminates. This hook receives two parameters:

        * conn_log: file object with connection log data
        * response_log: file object with HTTP response log data

        With the default client implementation conn_log will contain
        gnutls-cli output, and response_log the full HTTP responses
        (including status line and headers).
