**TODO:
- Handle Unclean Shutdowns
- make session cache use generic apache caches

** Version 0.7 (2015-07-12)
- Security fix for TLS client authentication (CVE-2015-2091)
- Bug fixes that enable support for reverse proxy operation
- Various test suite improvements. Tests are configured through autoconf,
  so the test suite now works for builds without Monkeysphere support.
- Add support for TLS connections to back end servers when operating as a
  reverse proxy (X.509 authentication only at the moment).
- PKCS #11 support for server keys and certificates
- Use strict compiler arguments by default (-Wall -Werror -Wextra)
- Allow limiting the size of certificates exported as SSL_SERVER_CERT
  and SSL_CLIENT_CERT through the GnuTLSExportCertificates directive

** Version 0.6 (2014-02-17)
- Generating DH Params instead of using static ones.
- Now considering ServerAlias Directives.
- Major Legacy Code Cleanup.
- html and pdf and manual documentation generated from markdown sources
- support monkeysphere validation agent (MSVA) client-certificate verification
- wider test suite
- GnuTLSExportCertificates off by default

** Version 0.5.10 (2011-07-12)
- Patched a bug responsible for excessive memory consumption by mod_gnutls.
- Support for proxying from SSL to plain HTTP was added (ie. proxy termination).

** Version 0.5.9 (2010-09-24)
- GnuTLSCache none is now an allowed option.
- Corrected behavior in Keep-Alive connections (do not
  terminate the connection prematurely)
- The GnuTLSCache variable now can be given the specific
  option "gdbm" instead of "dbm". "dbm" will use the berkeley
  db type of libapr while gdbm will force gdbm to be used.
  sdbm is no longer being used due to serious limitations.

** Version 0.5.8 (2010-08-18)
- Session tickets are enabled by default.
- Fixes some segmentation faults noticed in some
  configurations.

** Version 0.5.7 (2010-07-01)
- Force usage of SDBM. For some reason the default in
  my system had issues after reaching a limit of entries.
  SDBM seems stable so force it.
- Optimizations in session caching.
- Added support for session tickets. This allows a
  server to avoid using a session cache and still support
  session resumption. This is at the cost of transporting
  session data during handshake. New option
  GnuTLSSessionTickets [on|off]
- Depend on gnutls 2.10.0 to force support for safe
  renegotiation.

** Version 0.5.6 (2010-03-24)
- Corrected issue with firefox and long POST data (by
  handling EINTR and EAGAIN errors in read).
- Added support for chained client certificates
- Corrected more issues related to double frees

** Version 0.5.5 (2009-06-13)
- Removed limits on CA certificate loading. Reported by
  Sander Marechal and Jack Bates.
- Do not allow sending empty TLS packets even when instructed to.
  This had the side effect of clients closing connection.

** Version 0.5.4 (2009-01-04)
- mod_gnutls.h: modified definition to extern to avoid compilation
  errors in darwin.
- Added patch to fix issue with mod_proxy. Investigation and patch by Alain
  Knaff.
- libgnutls detection uses pkg-config.

** Version 0.5.3 (2008-10-16)
- Corrected bug to allow having an OpenPGP-only web site.
- Increased Max handshake tries due to interrupted system calls.

** Version 0.5.2 (2008-06-29)
- Depend on gnutls 2.4 which has openpgp support in main library.

** Version 0.5.1 (2008-03-05)
- Added --disable-srp configure option
- Better check for memcache (patch by Guillaume Rousse)
- Corrected possible memory leak in DBM support for resuming sessions.

** Version 0.5.0-alpha (2008-01-24)
- Added support for OpenPGP keys. The new directives are:
  GnuTLSPGPKeyringFile, GnuTLSPGPCertificateFile, GnuTLSPGPKeyFile

** Version 0.4.2 (2007-12-10)
- Added support for sending a certificate chain.
- Corrected bug which did not allow the TLS session cache to be used.
- Do not allow resuming sessions on different servers.

** Version 0.4.1 (2007-12-03)
- Added support for subject alternative names in certificates.
Only one per certificate is supported.
- New enviroment variables: SSL_CLIENT_M_VERSION, SSL_CLIENT_S_SAN%,
SSL_CLIENT_S_TYPE, SSL_SERVER_M_VERSION, SSL_SERVER_S_SAN%, SSL_SERVER_S_TYPE
- The compatibility mode can now be enabled explicitely with the
%COMPAT keyword at the GnuTLSPriorities string. It is no longer the default.
- Check for GnuTLSPriorities directive. This corrects a segfault. Thanks
to David Hrbáč.
- Better handling of GnuTLSDHFile and GnuTLSRSAFile.
- No longer default paths for RSA and DH parameter files.
