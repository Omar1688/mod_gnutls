** Version 0.8.0 (2016-12-11)
- New: Support for OCSP stapling
- Bugfix: Access to DBM cache is locked using global mutex
  "gnutls-cache"
- Bugfix: GnuTLSSessionTickets is now disabled by default as described
  in the handbook
- Fixed memory leak while checking proxy backend certificate
- Fixed memory leaks in post_config
- Safely delete session ticket key (requires GnuTLS >= 3.4)
- Improved error handling in post_config hook
- Various handbook updates
- Internal API documentation can be generated using Doxygen
- Unused code has been removed (conditionals for GnuTLS 2.x and Apache
  versions before 2.2, internal Lua bytecode structure last used in
  2011).
- Test suite: Fixed locking for access to the PGP keyring of the test
  certificate authority
- mod_gnutls can be built using Clang (unsupported)

** Version 0.7.5 (2016-05-28)
- Sunil Mohan Adapa reported retry loops during session shutdown in
  cleanup_gnutls_session() due to gnutls_bye() incorrectly returning
  GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN. Setting the GnuTLS session
  errno in mgs_transport_write() fixes the problem.
- Import Daniel Kahn Gillmor's patches for GnuPG v2 support from the
  Debian package.
- Build system improvements that allow VPATH builds and get "make
  distcheck" to work

** Version 0.7.4 (2016-04-13)
- Support SoftHSM 2 for PKCS #11 testing
- Increase verbosity of test logs

** Version 0.7.3 (2016-01-12)
- Update test suite for compatibility with GnuTLS 3.4, which has
  stricter key usage checks and priorities than 3.3.
- Write non-HTML output to mod_status reports if AP_STATUS_SHORT is
  set (mod_status sets it for requests with the "auto" parameter, e.g.
  https://localhost/server-status?auto).
- Register "ssl_is_https" function so the special mod_rewrite variable
  %{HTTPS} works correctly with mod_gnutls. The new test case for this
  requires Wget or curl. Fixes Debian bug #514005.
- Test suite servers listen on IPv4 *and* IPv6 loopback addresses by
  default (other addresses configurable), which should fix failures
  due to localhost randomly resolving to either on some distributions.
- Isolate tests using network namespaces, if possible. This avoids
  port conflicts with other test cases (so they can run in parallel)
  and host services.
- Support for local Apache drop-in config files in the test suite
  (e.g. to load additional modules needed on Fedora).
- Try to use markdown to build HTML documentation if pandoc is not
  available.
- Disable use of flock if it is unavailable or does not support
  timeouts (the latter caused the build to fail on Debian Hurd).
- New test: Disable TLS 1.0 (regression test for Debian bug #754960).

** Version 0.7.2 (2015-11-21)
- Bugfix: Non-blocking reads in the input filter could lead to a busy
  wait in the gnutls_io_input_read function, causing high load on
  Keep-Alive connections waiting for data, until either more data
  could be received or the connection was closed. The fix is to pass
  EAGAIN/EINTR results up to the input filter so they can be handled
  properly.
- Close TLS session if the input filter receives EOF (mostly relevant
  for proper termination of proxy connections).
- Remove dependency on APR Memcache, which is replaced by the newer
  version included in the APR Utility Library (libaprutil).
- Remove dependency on bc. It was used for floating point arithmetic
  in the test suite, the calculations have been changed to use
  integers and pure bash code.

** Version 0.7.1 (2015-10-18)
- Improved handling of PKCS #11 modules: mod_gnutls now loads either
  modules specified using GnuTLSP11Module, or the system defaults, but
  not both. Thanks to Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos for the report and
  initial patch!
- Initialize variables to safe defaults during client certificate
  verification. Certain error code paths did not set them, but they
  should never be hit due to config validation. This adds another line
  of defense.
- Enable C99 support via autoconf
- Test suite improvements. Most importantly, automake now handles
  environment setup without any external make calls. Rules to build
  the certificates are included from the old test makefile. Note that
  the dependency on GNU make is not new (the test makefile always used
  GNU make syntax), it just wasn't listed explicitly.

** Version 0.7 (2015-07-12)
- Security fix for TLS client authentication (CVE-2015-2091)
- Bug fixes that enable support for reverse proxy operation
- Various test suite improvements. Tests are configured through autoconf,
  so the test suite now works for builds without Monkeysphere support.
- Add support for TLS connections to back end servers when operating as a
  reverse proxy (X.509 authentication only at the moment).
- PKCS #11 support for server keys and certificates
- Use strict compiler arguments by default (-Wall -Werror -Wextra)
- Allow limiting the size of certificates exported as SSL_SERVER_CERT
  and SSL_CLIENT_CERT through the GnuTLSExportCertificates directive

** Version 0.6 (2014-02-17)
- Generating DH Params instead of using static ones.
- Now considering ServerAlias Directives.
- Major Legacy Code Cleanup.
- html and pdf and manual documentation generated from markdown sources
- support monkeysphere validation agent (MSVA) client-certificate verification
- wider test suite
- GnuTLSExportCertificates off by default

** Version 0.5.10 (2011-07-12)
- Patched a bug responsible for excessive memory consumption by mod_gnutls.
- Support for proxying from SSL to plain HTTP was added (ie. proxy termination).

** Version 0.5.9 (2010-09-24)
- GnuTLSCache none is now an allowed option.
- Corrected behavior in Keep-Alive connections (do not
  terminate the connection prematurely)
- The GnuTLSCache variable now can be given the specific
  option "gdbm" instead of "dbm". "dbm" will use the berkeley
  db type of libapr while gdbm will force gdbm to be used.
  sdbm is no longer being used due to serious limitations.

** Version 0.5.8 (2010-08-18)
- Session tickets are enabled by default.
- Fixes some segmentation faults noticed in some
  configurations.

** Version 0.5.7 (2010-07-01)
- Force usage of SDBM. For some reason the default in
  my system had issues after reaching a limit of entries.
  SDBM seems stable so force it.
- Optimizations in session caching.
- Added support for session tickets. This allows a
  server to avoid using a session cache and still support
  session resumption. This is at the cost of transporting
  session data during handshake. New option
  GnuTLSSessionTickets [on|off]
- Depend on gnutls 2.10.0 to force support for safe
  renegotiation.

** Version 0.5.6 (2010-03-24)
- Corrected issue with firefox and long POST data (by
  handling EINTR and EAGAIN errors in read).
- Added support for chained client certificates
- Corrected more issues related to double frees

** Version 0.5.5 (2009-06-13)
- Removed limits on CA certificate loading. Reported by
  Sander Marechal and Jack Bates.
- Do not allow sending empty TLS packets even when instructed to.
  This had the side effect of clients closing connection.

** Version 0.5.4 (2009-01-04)
- mod_gnutls.h: modified definition to extern to avoid compilation
  errors in darwin.
- Added patch to fix issue with mod_proxy. Investigation and patch by Alain
  Knaff.
- libgnutls detection uses pkg-config.

** Version 0.5.3 (2008-10-16)
- Corrected bug to allow having an OpenPGP-only web site.
- Increased Max handshake tries due to interrupted system calls.

** Version 0.5.2 (2008-06-29)
- Depend on gnutls 2.4 which has openpgp support in main library.

** Version 0.5.1 (2008-03-05)
- Added --disable-srp configure option
- Better check for memcache (patch by Guillaume Rousse)
- Corrected possible memory leak in DBM support for resuming sessions.

** Version 0.5.0-alpha (2008-01-24)
- Added support for OpenPGP keys. The new directives are:
  GnuTLSPGPKeyringFile, GnuTLSPGPCertificateFile, GnuTLSPGPKeyFile

** Version 0.4.2 (2007-12-10)
- Added support for sending a certificate chain.
- Corrected bug which did not allow the TLS session cache to be used.
- Do not allow resuming sessions on different servers.

** Version 0.4.1 (2007-12-03)
- Added support for subject alternative names in certificates.
Only one per certificate is supported.
- New enviroment variables: SSL_CLIENT_M_VERSION, SSL_CLIENT_S_SAN%,
SSL_CLIENT_S_TYPE, SSL_SERVER_M_VERSION, SSL_SERVER_S_SAN%, SSL_SERVER_S_TYPE
- The compatibility mode can now be enabled explicitely with the
%COMPAT keyword at the GnuTLSPriorities string. It is no longer the default.
- Check for GnuTLSPriorities directive. This corrects a segfault. Thanks
to David Hrbáč.
- Better handling of GnuTLSDHFile and GnuTLSRSAFile.
- No longer default paths for RSA and DH parameter files.
