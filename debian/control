Description: Apache module for TLS encryption with GnuTLS
 mod_gnutls provides TLS encryption using the GnuTLS library. It's
 similar in purpose to mod_ssl, but doesn't use OpenSSL, and provides
 some additional features:
  * Background OCSP stapling,
  * PKCS #11 access to server keys and certificates,
  * using Monkeysphere for client certificate validation.
